Our project is a student information system project. 5 SPs, 3 triggers, 3 functions and 1 view were used in the project. When the user login screen opens, the user enters his ID and password and is directed to the academician or student screen. Additionally, if my student is not registered, he or she can register from the register screen. If he forgot his password, he can change his password from the I forgot my password screen.
